# Decision Trees Analysis

## Background
Decision Trees provide an interpretable approach to understanding development patterns through hierarchical decision rules. This implementation focuses on creating transparent, rule-based models that can explain the relationships between economic development, environmental impact, and social indicators. The tree structure offers insights into the critical thresholds and decision boundaries that separate different development categories.

## Theory
Decision Trees are hierarchical models that:
1. Recursively partition the feature space
2. Use information gain or Gini impurity to select splits
3. Create decision rules based on feature thresholds
4. Form a tree structure with nodes and leaves

Key concepts:
- Information Gain and Gini Impurity
- Binary splitting criteria
- Tree depth and complexity
- Pruning strategies
- Feature importance calculation
- Path-dependent decision making
- Leaf node statistics
- Cross-validation strategies

## Scope
### Primary Objectives
- Create interpretable decision rules for development classification
- Identify critical thresholds in development indicators
- Analyze feature importance hierarchies
- Study interaction effects between indicators
- Provide transparent policy recommendations

### Research Questions
1. What are the key thresholds that distinguish development levels?
2. How do environmental factors influence development paths?
3. What role does military expenditure play in development?
4. Which combinations of indicators best predict development status?

## Implementation Details
### Data Preprocessing
1. Feature Selection and Engineering:
   - Primary features: GDP per capita, Life Expectancy, GHG Emissions
   - Secondary features: Labor Force Participation, Military Expenditure
   - Categorical encoding: Region and Income Group
   - Feature scaling: Optional for decision trees

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Missing value handling with domain-specific strategies
   - Outlier retention (trees are robust to outliers)
   - Categorical variable encoding
   - Date-based feature creation

3. Feature Transformation:
   - Binning continuous variables
   - Creating interaction features
   - Ratio calculations
   - Temporal aggregations

### Algorithm Configuration
1. Tree Structure:
   - Maximum depth optimization
   - Minimum samples per leaf
   - Minimum samples for split
   - Maximum features per split

2. Split Criteria:
   - Information gain calculation
   - Gini impurity measurement
   - Split threshold selection
   - Feature selection at nodes

3. Pruning Strategy:
   - Cost-complexity pruning
   - Validation-based pruning
   - Minimum impurity decrease
   - Maximum leaf nodes

### Visualization Approach
1. Tree Structure:
   - Full tree visualization
   - Pruned tree comparison
   - Node statistics display
   - Path highlighting

2. Feature Analysis:
   - Feature importance plots
   - Split point distribution
   - Node purity visualization
   - Path contribution analysis

3. Results Visualization:
   - Decision surface plots
   - Feature interaction maps
   - Error analysis by path
   - Regional distribution analysis
