# Ensemble Learning Analysis

## Background
Ensemble Learning combines multiple machine learning algorithms to create a more robust and comprehensive analysis of the relationships between wealth, health, and environmental impact. This implementation leverages the strengths of different models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks) to create a sophisticated development index that captures complex interactions between economic indicators, health outcomes, environmental metrics, and military expenditure. The ensemble approach helps mitigate individual model biases while providing more reliable predictions and insights.

## Theory
Ensemble Learning methods combine multiple models through:
1. Voting/Averaging: Combining predictions from different models
2. Stacking: Using a meta-model to learn optimal combinations
3. Bagging: Bootstrap aggregation for variance reduction
4. Boosting: Sequential learning to reduce bias

Key concepts:
- Model diversity and complementarity
- Bias-variance trade-off
- Error correlation reduction
- Meta-learning strategies
- Cross-validation techniques
- Model weight optimization
- Prediction calibration
- Uncertainty estimation

## Scope
### Primary Objectives
- Create a comprehensive development index incorporating all indicators
- Combine predictions from multiple models for robust analysis
- Identify complex patterns in development trajectories
- Analyze interactions between economic, social, and environmental factors
- Generate reliable policy recommendations

### Research Questions
1. How do different models capture various aspects of development?
2. What are the synergies between economic growth and environmental sustainability?
3. How do military expenditure and labor force participation interact?
4. Which development indicators show the strongest cross-model consensus?
