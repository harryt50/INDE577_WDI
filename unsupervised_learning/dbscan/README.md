# DBSCAN Clustering Analysis

## Background
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is employed to identify natural groupings of countries or regions based on their geospatial proximity and development indicators, such as wealth (GDP per capita), health (life expectancy), environmental impact (GHG emissions per capita), and social factors (labor force participation). Unlike K-Means, which requires specifying the number of clusters and assumes spherical clusters, DBSCAN leverages density to form clusters of arbitrary shapes and naturally identifies outliers (e.g., isolated or underdeveloped regions). This approach provides insights into dense development hubs and anomalous regions, aiding in regional planning and policy-making.

## Theory
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that:
1. Groups points in high-density regions (within a radius ε) into clusters.
2. Identifies core points (with at least MinPts neighbors within ε), border points (within ε of core points), and noise (outliers).
3. Expands clusters by connecting core points and their neighbors.
4. Does not require specifying the number of clusters.

Key concepts:
- Distance metrics (Euclidean distance for geospatial and feature space).
- Density reachability and connectivity.
- Parameter tuning (ε and MinPts).
- K-distance plot for ε estimation.
- Outlier detection.
- Feature scaling for multi-dimensional data.
- Cluster stability and sensitivity analysis.

## Scope
### Primary Objectives
1. Identify dense development hubs and anomalous regions based on:
   - Geospatial coordinates (latitude, longitude).
   - Economic indicators (GDP per capita).
   - Health outcomes (life expectancy).
   - Environmental impact (GHG emissions per capita).
   - Social factors (labor force participation).

2. Analyze cluster and outlier characteristics:
   - Dense urban or economic hubs.
   - Isolated or underdeveloped regions.
   - Environmental-social trade-offs.
   - Regional development patterns.

### Research Questions
1. What are the dense development hubs across countries or regions?
2. Which regions are outliers in terms of development or geospatial isolation?
3. How do environmental and social factors influence dense clusters?
4. Are there geospatial patterns in development anomalies?

## Implementation Details
### Data Preprocessing
1. Feature Selection:
   - Core indicators: Latitude, Longitude, GDP per capita, Life Expectancy, GHG Emissions per capita.
   - Secondary indicators: Labor Force Participation.
   - Derived metrics: GHG to GDP ratio, Economic density (GDP per unit area).

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Missing value imputation using mean/median for numerical features.
   - Outlier detection for extreme values (e.g., GDP per capita).
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler) for all features to ensure fair distance calculations.
   - Log transformation for skewed features (e.g., GDP per capita, GHG emissions).

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Spatial density calculations (e.g., number of neighboring countries within a radius).
   - Interaction terms (e.g., GDP × Life Expectancy).
   - Regional categorical variables for post-clustering analysis.
   - Dimensionality reduction (optional PCA for visualization).

### Algorithm Configuration
1. Model Setup:
   - DBSCAN implementation from scikit-learn.
   - ε estimation via k-distance plot.
   - MinPts set based on dimensionality (e.g., 2 * number of features).
   - Multiple parameter combinations for sensitivity analysis.

2. Hyperparameters:
   - eps: determined by k-distance plot (e.g., 0.5–2.0).
   - min_samples: 4–10 (based on domain knowledge and data density).
   - metric: 'euclidean'.
   - algorithm: 'auto' (ball_tree for efficiency with geospatial data).

### Visualization Approach
1. Cluster Analysis:
   - 2D scatter plots of geospatial coordinates with cluster coloring.
   - 2D/3D scatter plots of principal components (if PCA applied).
   - K-distance plot for ε selection.
   - Silhouette plots for cluster quality (excluding noise).

2. Cluster and Outlier Profiling:
   - Geographic visualizations (e.g., folium maps) showing clusters and outliers.
   - Box plots for feature distributions across clusters and noise points.
   - Radar charts for cluster characteristics (e.g., average GDP, life expectancy).
   - Heatmaps for regional density of clusters.

3. Interpretation Tools:
   - Summary statistics for clusters and outliers.
   - Feature importance analysis (e.g., which features drive density).
   - Geospatial anomaly analysis.
   - Comparison of results across ε and MinPts values.
