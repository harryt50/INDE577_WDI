# K-Means Clustering Analysis

## Background
K-Means Clustering is employed to discover natural groupings of countries based on their development indicators, including wealth (GDP per capita), health (life expectancy), environmental impact (GHG emissions per capita), labor force participation, military expenditure, and debt service. This unsupervised learning approach helps identify distinct development patterns and understand how countries cluster based on multiple dimensions of development, providing insights into common characteristics and challenges faced by different groups of nations.

## Theory
K-Means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that:
1. Partitions data into K clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance
2. Uses iterative refinement to find cluster centers (centroids)
3. Assigns points to nearest centroid using distance metrics
4. Updates centroids based on mean of assigned points

Key concepts:
- Distance metrics (Euclidean distance)
- Centroid initialization (k-means++)
- Convergence criteria
- Inertia and distortion measures
- Silhouette analysis
- Elbow method for optimal K
- Feature scaling importance
- Cluster stability assessment

## Scope
### Primary Objectives
1. Identify distinct country development profiles considering:
   - Economic indicators (GDP per capita)
   - Health outcomes (life expectancy)
   - Environmental impact (GHG emissions per capita)
   - Social factors (labor force participation)
   - Financial metrics (debt service)
   - Military spending

2. Analyze cluster characteristics:
   - Common development patterns
   - Regional distributions
   - Economic-environmental trade-offs
   - Military-development relationships

### Research Questions
1. How many distinct development patterns exist among countries?
2. What role does environmental impact play in country groupings?
3. How do labor participation and military spending influence cluster formation?
4. Are there regional patterns in cluster membership?

## Implementation Details
### Data Preprocessing
1. Feature Selection:
   - Core indicators: GDP per capita, Life Expectancy, GHG Emissions per capita
   - Secondary indicators: Military Expenditure, Labor Force Participation, Debt Service
   - Derived metrics: Military to GDP ratio, GHG to GDP ratio

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Missing value imputation using mean/median
   - Outlier detection and treatment
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
   - Log transformation for skewed features

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Ratio calculations
   - Interaction terms
   - Regional groupings
   - Development categories

### Algorithm Configuration
1. Model Setup:
   - K-means++ initialization
   - Multiple random starts
   - Optimal K selection via elbow method
   - Silhouette analysis for validation

2. Hyperparameters:
   - n_clusters: determined by elbow method
   - init: 'k-means++'
   - n_init: 10
   - max_iter: 300
   - tol: 1e-4

### Visualization Approach
1. Cluster Analysis:
   - 2D/3D scatter plots of principal components
   - Feature pair plots with cluster coloring
   - Silhouette plots
   - Elbow curve visualization

2. Cluster Profiling:
   - Radar charts for cluster characteristics
   - Box plots for feature distributions
   - Regional distribution heatmaps
   - Cluster centroid analysis

3. Interpretation Tools:
   - Cluster summary statistics
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Geographic visualizations
   - Temporal trend analysis
