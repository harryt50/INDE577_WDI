# Random Forests Analysis

## Background
Random Forests provide a powerful ensemble learning approach to predict and analyze GHG emissions per capita based on economic, social, and military indicators. This implementation leverages the collective power of multiple decision trees to create robust predictions while handling the complex relationships between development indicators. The ensemble nature of Random Forests helps capture non-linear interactions between wealth metrics, health outcomes, and military expenditure, while providing reliable feature importance rankings.

## Theory
Random Forests are ensemble models that:
1. Create multiple decision trees using bootstrap samples
2. Implement random feature selection at each split
3. Aggregate predictions through majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression)
4. Provide out-of-bag error estimates and feature importance measures

Key concepts:
- Bootstrap aggregation (bagging)
- Random feature selection
- Out-of-bag (OOB) error estimation
- Feature importance calculation
- Proximity analysis
- Variable interaction detection
- Partial dependence plots
- Permutation importance

## Scope
### Primary Objectives
- Predict GHG emissions per capita from development indicators
- Identify key drivers of environmental impact
- Analyze feature interactions and importance
- Assess military expenditure's role in emissions
- Provide robust policy recommendations

### Research Questions
1. What combination of development indicators best predicts GHG emissions?
2. How does military expenditure influence environmental impact?
3. What are the relative importances of economic vs. social factors?
4. Are there interaction effects between development indicators?
